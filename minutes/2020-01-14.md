## Reminders

None this week!

## Agenda

* `cortex-m` exposes unsafe cache invalidation operations as safe https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/188 (see also https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/189)
    * Agreement they should not be safe if they have invariants which need to be upheld
        * Action item for @adamgreig to propose a resolution
* The road to 1.0:
  * Proposal to reshape `svd2rust` generated code: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/427
      * Cannot be implemented as is
      * @adamgreig is not seeing conflicts with stm32-rs
  * @adamgreig is working on making Cortex-M PACs and identifying issues
      * Figuring out how to structure the various architecture dependent crates in the best way
          * Probably a single crate with all PACs config gated
  * Change PAC API exposed by `svd2rust` to reduce chaining (and formatting woes)
      * Pros and cons discussed
      * baloo_ made a suggestion, see homework below
  * Change the way we manage `embedded-hal` (aka gettting rid of `unproven` feature flag): https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/blob/revising-unproven/rfcs/0415-revising-unproven.md
      * Now a proper RFC and ready for voting

## Didn't get to this week

* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/186
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/237
* Transfer https://github.com/japaric/msp430-quickstart to rust-embedded?
* digital::v3 RFC voting?

## Action Items

* [ ] @adamgreig to come up with a proposal for https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/188
* [ ] @all homework: Check out https://github.com/nsmryan/myopic/blob/master/benches/bench.rs#L73 for svd2rust generated API

## Last Week's Agenda

* Goals for 2020?
  * 1.0 release for embedded-hal
      * Still major open items to figure out before it can go 1.0
  * 1.0 release for cortex-m
  * 1.0 release for cortex-m-rt
  * 1.0 release for svd2rust
      * General agreement to start a bottom up approach stabilizing each foundational crate one by one (r0, bare-metal, cortex-m, cortex-m-rt...)
      * Attempt to pace at a 6 weeks schedule
      * Rough release criteria:
          * We can slip for "it's unsound", or "the docs aren't ready"
          * Let's not slip for "I know it could be better"
  * Oxidize 2020 ;)
      * Maaaaaaaybe :D
* Stopping all the good embedded projects sneaking into TWiR instead of our blog!

## Last Week's Action Items

* [ ] Tell your friends about the WG and the newsletter!
* [ ] James to write a tweet promoting the newsletter, and to have people add their stuff to it
