## This Week's Agenda

* Mutex Trait Naming
    * Consensus on naming: `mutex-trait`
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/156
    * Suggestion to base this on musca-b1 because it's shiny and new and Cortex-M33
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/pull/171
    * Discussion about whether it's a good idea to use the heavily async-await based contract `core::task::Poll` instead of `nb`
        * Pro: Use of core components instead of custom crates
        * Con: Maybe not idea for non-async use cases
        * Needs a RFC for experimentation and comments
*  CONTROL::FPCA register - add reset method to cortex-m? (See https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0403/eb/DDI0403E_B_armv7m_arm.pdf page 575)
    * Shouldn't require much discussion, can be added with a PR to cortex-m
* Meeting agenda for next week, back to using agenda tracking issues:
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/398
* https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/212
    * Requires a new release to fix soundness issue
        * Consensus on releasing as a minor release potentially causing breakage upon abuse of the unsoundness
        * No consensus on yanking older versions of 0.6
        * As a bonus: New release will yield reproducible builds

## This Week's Action Items

* [ ] @jamesmunns to write a proposal about a monorepo for books (still todo)
* [ ] Someone to add "update your cortex-m-rt" with instructions to the blog posts

## Last Week's Agenda

* Mutex Trait (@korken89)
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/377
            * Reference impl: https://github.com/korken89/core-mutex/blob/master/src/lib.rs
            * After discussion: let's merge the RFC
* Randomizing symbol names vs. reproducible builds (@jschievink):
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/205
            * Waiting for @jschievink to implement the trampoline approach
            * Meeting participants in favour of getting rid of the randomizing hack
            * Still no update on this matter
* digital::v3 RFC (@Disasm)
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/393
        * Join the discussion in the RFC
* Changing the way embedded-hal receives cool stuff: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/163
    * Meeting participants in favour proposal, potentially to go in trinity with digital::v3 and to-be-written proposal about splitting up embedded-hal into subcrates
* Monolithic book(s)? (@jamesmunns)

* Didn't get to this week:
    * CONTROL::FPCA register - add reset method to cortex-m? (See https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0403/eb/DDI0403E_B_armv7m_arm.pdf page 575)
        * Shouldn't require much discussion, can be added with a PR to cortex-m

## Last Week's Action Items

* [ ] @thejpster to write an RFC about splitting up embedded-hal into seperately versioned subcrates
* [ ] @jamesmunns to write a proposal about a monorepo for books
