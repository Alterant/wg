    * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67018
    * Possible workaround that could be useful: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/aecb51149dbe2f3e8745c646ebfdc992624188cf/src/test/run-make/removing-code-and-incremental-lto/Makefile#L7-L11

* cortex-m-rt regression
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/issues/223
    * japaric: "IMO, the function with the user code should be #[inline(always)] and all the attributes should be put on the exception handler (e.g. SysTick). Use of (the unstable) #[naked] should tell you to use (stable) external assembly"
* VS_Code Support
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart/pull/78
