# Agenda
## Rust requests

**Prioritized**

1. const generics / Fix rust-lang/rust#42863 - "Generic associated consts can't currently be used to parameterize fixed array lengths"
2. Stabilize const fn-s that have trait bounds, e.g. const fn new() -> Mutex where T: Send.


3. Stabilize core::mem::MaybeUninit


4. std::io in libcore/liballoc - https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/portability-wg/issues/12
- there are several reimplementations of io::{Read,Write} traits on crates.io


5. fix rust-lang/cargo#5730 - "Features of dependencies are enabled if they're enabled in build-dependencies; breaks no_std libs"


6. std-aware Cargo / Xargo in Cargo (58 votes) - https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/4959

use cases:

- cross compilation to custom targets like GBA, PS*, other consoles. Also armv8-m (for now)
- recompile core / std with different codegen options (e.g. opt-level=s)
- enable / disable Cargo features of core / std crates. e.g. turn panic! into intrinsics::abort


7. Improve crates.io or create separate site for no_std crates


8. Support for AVR - https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/3


9. Stabilize async/await (and all needed underlying machinery)


10. math support in core - https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2505
- you can get math stuff by depending on libm; this would remove one extra dependency
- if it’s in core then it’s possible to optimize the routines using asm! / simd while still being able to use the math functions on stable

**TODO**


2. Stabilize RFC 2282 - "Cargo profile dependencies" AKA profile-overrides
3. Fix so infinite loops (loop {}) does not need an atomic compiler fence to not be optimized into an abort instruction
4. ability to assert within a const fn context, with a compilation error if the assertion fails at compile time and a panic if the assertion fails at runtime.
5. Language support for types with storage size of less than 1 byte
6. Thumb intrinsics (10 votes)
