## Agenda

* PSAs
    * Embedded-WG reorganisation has happened: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/476
    * adamgreig joined the embedded WG core team (and @jamesmunns stepped down): https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/463
    * Highfive is finally up-to-date: https://github.com/rust-lang/highfive/pull/272
        * Also documented how to keep it up-to-date: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/blob/master/ops/highfive.md

* Focus projects
    * DMA
        * Discussion in rust-lang Zulip around sequencing start/stop operations

* Weekly meeting format: agenda issues or nominated issues or something else?

* Road to 1.0
    * embedded-hal: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/177
    * cortex-m
        * Division into multiple crates? Move singleton control to cortex-m-rt?
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/241
        * We discussed various options for a split and what to do about a 1.0 release: for now the conclusion is to start planning what a 1.0 would look like without substantial changes and in parallel we can plan an alternative set of cortex-m crates which implement the split idea.
