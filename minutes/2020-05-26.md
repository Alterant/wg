    * bare-metal:
        * Rough idea: Release current state as 1.0 and deprecate it afterwards paving the way for independent architecture crates to move away from current `Mutex`
        * Issue with new `Mutex` trait: https://github.com/rust-embedded/mutex-trait/issues/12
        * Possible idea for next focus group?
