## Last Week's Agenda

* Open items
    * Libs/Community Team - Help Wanted
    * embedded-hal finalize roadmap
* Frame Pointers / Unwind Tables / Backtraces (RISC-V: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69890)
  * Default setting for frame pointers, uwtables and backtraces (in light of https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/69890)
  * This change only applies to RISC-V
  * We're good (as long as the change is verified to still give good backtraces)
* Do we want to `#[cfg]`-gate fields of `cortex_m::Peripherals`? It has some drawbacks: https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/181#issuecomment-568524422
    * Kick discussion to the issue for now
    * Should be discussed pre-1.0
* Plans for AVR support once merged to rust-lang/rust?
* embedded-hal 1.0 branch
