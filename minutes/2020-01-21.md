## Action Items

## Last Week's Agenda

* `cortex-m` exposes unsafe cache invalidation operations as safe https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/issues/188 (see also https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m/pull/189)
    * Agreement they should not be safe if they have invariants which need to be upheld
        * Action item for @adamgreig to propose a resolution
* The road to 1.0:
  * Proposal to reshape `svd2rust` generated code: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust/issues/427
      * Cannot be implemented as is
      * @adamgreig is not seeing conflicts with stm32-rs
  * @adamgreig is working on making Cortex-M PACs and identifying issues
      * Figuring out how to structure the various architecture dependent crates in the best way
          * Probably a single crate with all PACs config gated
  * Change PAC API exposed by `svd2rust` to reduce chaining (and formatting woes)
      * Pros and cons discussed
      * baloo_ made a suggestion, see homework below
  * Change the way we manage `embedded-hal` (aka gettting rid of `unproven` feature flag): https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/blob/revising-unproven/rfcs/0415-revising-unproven.md
      * Now a proper RFC and ready for voting
