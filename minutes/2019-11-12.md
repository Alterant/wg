## This Week's Agenda

* From last week:
    * Foundational crates push to 1.0
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/383
        * cortex-m
            * Still has unsound mutex
                * Issue #?
        * svd2rust - still in flux
        * Major version support policy?
            * Only current major?
            * Current and previous major (debian style)?
        * Homework: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2803
        * RFC: Official support policy (at least for >= 1.0.0)?
        * Make tracking issue(s) for crate stabilization?
    * Changing the way embedded-hal receives cool stuff: https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/163
    * Infra team is asking whether we would like to use Rust infrastructure more and are willing to have their bot have full access to embedded WG repositories, giving us:
        * Proper team membership handling including sub-teams
        * Automatic permission handling for all bots and repositories
        * Sub-team displays on the Rust Governance page
        * Access to all current and new bots they run, cf. https://github.com/rust-lang/team
    * PSA from adamgreig: stm32-rs 0.9 was released ðŸŽ‰

* Didn't get to this week:
    * Mutex Trait (@korken89)
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/pull/377
            * No consensus about associated type, slight preference of `Data`
            * Reference impl: https://github.com/korken89/core-mutex/blob/master/src/lib.rs
    * Randomizing symbol names vs. reproducible builds (@jschievink):
        * https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt/pull/205
            * Waiting for @jschievink to implement the trampoline approach
            * Meeting participants in favour of getting rid of the randomizing hack

## This Week's Action Items
* [ ] Read https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2803
* [ ] Add notes re: stabilization to the tracking issue

## Crates to Stabilize

Please list for each crate: "Why" and "Any Blockers". Ex:

* crate-foo
    * Why: It's used by every bar
    * Blockers: Needs `baz` to stabilize

### List:

* [`cortex-m`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m)
    * Why: Foundational to majority of supported MCUs
    * Blockers:
        * MMIO/Register reference soundness?
        * Possibly need to use `svd2rust` for peripherals?
* [`cortex-m-rt`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-rt)
    * Why: Foundational to majority of supported MCUs
    * Blockers: Review pending RFCs/PRs for potential breaking changes
        * ramfuncs, more user defined memory segments
* [`aligned`](https://github.com/japaric/aligned)
    * Why: `cortex-m` depends on it
    * Blockers:
* [`as-slice`](https://github.com/japaric/as-slice)
    * Why: `aligned` depends on it
    * Blockers:
* [`generic-array`](https://github.com/fizyk20/generic-array)
    * Why:
        * Used for generic numeric types until const generics lands
        * Still a number of issues to address for [const generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-const-generics) as of today
    * Blockers:
* [`bare-metal`](https://github.com/japaric/bare-metal)
    * Why: Foundational to pretty much every MCU application written in Rust
    * Blockers: Not in WG hand, depends on @japaric / @korken89
* [`vcell`](https://github.com/japaric/vcell)
    * Why: `svd2rust`-generated crates and `cortex-m` depend on it
    * Blockers:
* [`volatile-register`](https://github.com/japaric/vcell)
    * Why:
        * Primary abstraction for MMIO
    * Blockers:
        * potential MMIO soundness issues (spurious reads)
* [`panic-halt`](https://github.com/korken89/panic-halt)
    * Why: This has become one of the primary panic implementations, which is necessary for a `#![no_std]`application
    * Blockers:
        * Probably none, @korken89 is interested in making it happen
* [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal)
    * Why: Foundational for applications using common peripherals
    * Blockers:
        * Many open issues, lots of peripherals still missing
        * `digital::v1` vs. `digital::v2` kerfuffle
        * Lots of traits are `unproven`
* [`svd2rust`](https://github.com/japaric/vcell)
    * Why: Main tool to generate register interfaces for MCUs
    * Blockers: More optimisation to make created code sound and viable for production, still very slow and bloaty
* [`heapless`](https://github.com/japaric/heapless)
    * Why: Some things are some much nicer if they can use dynamic memory
    * Blockers: Not in WG hand, depends on @japaric / @korken89

### Crates we need

* `panic-reset`
* Some kind of basic stable allocator?
    * `alloc-cortex-m` still unstable, blocked on https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51540
* `async`/`await` support and a task executor
    * Blocked on: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62918
