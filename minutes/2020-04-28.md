## Embedded Lang Item Wish List

Note, this was a brainstorming session during one meeting. We plan to iterate on this, prioritize, etc.

Link to chat log, wish list discussion starts here: https://freenode.logbot.info/rust-embedded/20200428#c3752795

### Items

* `Sync` and `Send` on non-hosted, multi core systems
    * https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/blob/master/rfcs/0419-multi-core-soundness.md - TL;DR:
    * TL;DR: `Send` and `Sync` only work within one "environment". On hosted applications, the operating system handles this (via virtual memory). On non-hosted applications (bare metal, multicore processors), `Send` and `Sync` are not "good enough" for this use case
    * Today on a single core processor, we use `Send` and `Sync` to model the main application and each interrupt context as separate "threads" (which never run concurrently).
    * In the future, we want to define our own `MulticoreSend` and `MulticoreSync` which are usable in a bare metal, multicore processor
* 'Non-contiguous pointers' or 'pointers of incompatible type's
    * near/far pointers
    * `__flash` pointers on AVR, or disjoint addr spaces in general
    * Relevant for:
        * Multi Core devices with disparate address spaces
        * Weird architectures
        * Arm SecureZone
        * WASM (spec defines multiple addr spaces)
* Certain attributes/flags should probably require unsafe
    * `#[link_section]`
    * `#[no_mangle]`
        * Deprecated in favor of the "needs/provides thing"?
    * `-Clink-args`
    * `-C linker="unsafe { rust-lld }"` /s
* Const generics
* Const trait bounds
* Inline ASM
* Arbitrary size types (a la the recent C/C++ proposals)
    * Successor to https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2581 ?
    * Also/inclusive of bitfields? (some contention around this)
* `#[link_args]` (to avoid requiring `.cargo/config`)
* Placing/allocation within a certain linker section within `const` context/`static` items, e.g. `static S: &str = "foo";`
    * Right now you can state where `S` is placed (just the reference), but you can't place `"foo"`

### Items - maybe not?

* MMIO/dereferencable thing
    * Are raw pointers good enough?
    * is `&raw` relevant?
    * `UndereferencableCell` /s ?
* Panic Formatting
* Some libs requests, like:
    * non-global allocators
    * allow for defining a global allocator stable-y
* Breaking changes to `std` to allow for easier move/reuse in `core`?
    * `Read`, `Write`, `Error` traits?
