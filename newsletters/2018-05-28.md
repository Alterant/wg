## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* [rudihorn] shared [light-cli], a lightweight, no_std, and heapless CLI tool
* [Paolo Teti] shared [ti-hercules-bsp], a board support package for Texas Instruments TMS570 MCUs, used by safety critical industries such as automotive and aerospace
* [Marcel Buesing] posted their driver crate for the [bme680] environmental sensor
* [Roy Smeding] is working on support for the [stm32f334] chip from STMicro
* The [Embedded WG]'s own [Jonathan Soo] announced his project, [Bobbin SDK], a set of tools to make it easier to share code between different chips from the same or different vendors

## Help Wanted

* Some members of the embedded WG will attend the [RustFest] impl days in two weeks. If you want to make Rust awesome for embedded development come help us! We have [tasks with mentors and some hardware to give away!][impl-days]. Let us know if you are interested in helping out by commenting on that issue.
