# Singletons

> I see quite a bit of overlap between singletons and the "static guarantess" and "dynamic data structures" sections. It may be best to write those two first and the decide whether we want a standalone section on singletons (I think a standalone section would end up being too short and / or may not properly showcase its usefulness without applying it to something like configuration or memory management).
