# Summary

The purpose of this RFC is to provide an API to access to low level, ARM
specific SIMD and non-SIMD instructions on *stable* Rust.

# Motivation

*TODO* (stable channel, less error prone than writing your own assembly, no
extra build dependency to assembly external files (e.g `arm-none-eabi-gcc`))

# Detailed design

## ACLE: What and why

*TODO*

> The Arm architecture includes features that go beyond the set of operations
> available to C/C++ programmers. The intention of the Arm C Language Extensions
> (ACLE) is to allow the writing of applications and middleware code that is
> portable across compilers, and across Arm architecture variants, while
> exploiting the advanced features of the Arm architecture.

## Memory barriers

Reference: Section 7.3 "Memory barriers" of [ACLE].

### API

The following API will be available under `{core,std}::arch::{arm,aarch64}` and
will be available for both the "arm" and "aarch64" architectures unless
indicated otherwise (see `target_arch`).

``` rust
/// Generates a DMB (data memory barrier) instruction or equivalent CP15 instruction.
///
/// DMB ensures the observed ordering of memory accesses. Memory accesses of the
/// specified type issued before the DMB are guaranteed to be observed (in the
/// specified scope) before memory accesses issued after the DMB.
///
/// For example, DMB should be used between storing data, and updating a flag
/// variable that makes that data available to another core.
///
/// The __dmb() intrinsic also acts as a compiler memory barrier of the
/// appropriate type.
pub unsafe fn __dmb<A>(arg: A) where A: Dmb { /* .. */ }

/// Generates a DSB (data synchronization barrier) instruction or equivalent
/// CP15 instruction.
///
/// DSB ensures the completion of memory accesses. A DSB behaves as the
/// equivalent DMB and has additional properties. After a DSB instruction
/// completes, all memory accesses of the specified type issued before the DSB
/// are guaranteed to have completed.
///
/// The __dsb() intrinsic also acts as a compiler memory barrier of the
/// appropriate type.
pub unsafe fn __dsb<A>(arg: A) where A: Dsb { /* .. */ }

/// Generates an ISB (instruction synchronization barrier) instruction or
/// equivalent CP15 instruction.
///
/// This instruction flushes the processor pipeline fetch buffers, so that
/// following instructions are fetched from cache or memory.
///
/// An ISB is needed after some system maintenance operations. An ISB is also
/// needed before transferring control to code that has been loaded or modified
/// in memory, for example by an overlay mechanism or just-in-time code
/// generator.  (Note that if instruction and data caches are separate,
/// privileged cache maintenance operations would be needed in order to unify
/// the caches.)
///
/// The only supported argument for the __isb() intrinsic is 15, corresponding
/// to the SY (full system) scope of the ISB instruction.
pub unsafe fn __isb<A>(arg: A) where A: Isb { /* .. */ }

// Arguments to the above intrinsics

/// Full system is the required shareability domain, reads and writes are the
/// required access types
pub struct SY;

/// Full system is the required shareability domain, writes are the required
/// access type
pub struct ST;

/// Full system is the required shareability domain, reads are the required
/// access type
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
pub struct LD;

/// Inner Shareable is the required shareability domain, reads and writes are
/// the required access types
pub struct ISH;

/// Inner Shareable is the required shareability domain, reads are the required
/// access type
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
pub struct ISHLD;

/// Inner Shareable is the required shareability domain, writes are the required
/// access type
pub struct ISHST;

/// Non-shareable is the required shareability domain, reads and writes are the
/// required access types
pub struct NSH;

/// Non-shareable is the required shareability domain, reads are the required
/// access type
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
pub struct NSHLD;

/// Non-shareable is the required shareability domain, writes are the required
/// access type
pub struct NSHST;

/// Outer Shareable is the required shareability domain, reads and writes are
/// the required access types
pub struct OSH;

/// Outher Shareable is the required shareability domain, reads are the required
/// access type
#[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]
pub struct OSHLD;

/// Outer Shareable is the required shareability domain, writes are the required
/// access type
pub struct OSHST;

// The following `struct`s implement the `Dmb` and `Dsb` traits:
// SY, LD, ST, ISH, ISHLD, ISHST, NSH, NSHST, OSH, OSHLD, OSHST
//
// Only SY implements the `Isb` trait
```

### Example usage

``` rust
use core::arch::arm::{self, SY}

unsafe {
    // omitted: write to the SCB peripheral to invalidate some cache

    arm::__dsb(SY);
    arm::__isb(SY);
}
```

In C, this would be written as:

``` c
// ommitted part

__dsb(0xF);
__dmb(0xF);
```

### Implementation

Quoting [ACLE][] (Section 7.3):

> The intrinsics in this section are available for all targets. They may be
> no-ops (i.e. generate no code, but possibly act as a code motion barrier in
> compilers) on targets where the relevant instructions do not exist, but only
> if the property they guarantee would have held anyway.  On targets where the
> relevant instructions exist but are implemented as no-ops, these intrinsics
> generate the instructions.

Furthermore the table 10.1 in [ACLE] indicates:

| Instruction | Flags | Arch.     | Intrinsic or C code |
| ----------- | ----- | -----     | ------------------- |
| DMB         |       | 8, 7, 6-M | __dmb               |
| DSB         |       | 8, 7, 6-M | __dsb               |
| ISB         |       | 8, 7, 6-M | __isb               |

Where the architecture numbers mean (quoting Section 10.1 of [ACLE] ):

> Architecture 8 means Armv8-A AArch32 and AArch64, 8-32 means Armv8-AArch32
> only.

> Architecture 7 means Armv7-A and Armv7-R.

> In the sequence of Thumb-only architectures { 6-M, 7-M, 7E-M } each
> architecture includes its predecessor instruction set.

Thus the memory barriers will be implemented as follows:

``` rust
pub trait Dmb: sealed::Trait {
    unsafe fn dmb(&self);
}

mod sealed {
    trait Trait {}
}

pub unsafe fn __dmb<A>(arg: A) where A: Dmb {
    arg.dmb()
}

impl Dmb for SY {
    #[cfg(any(
        target_feature = "mclass", // 6-M
        target_feature = "v7", // 7
        target_arch = "aarch64" // 8
    ))]
    unsafe fn dmb(&self) {
        asm!("dmb 0xF" : : : "memory" : "volatile");
    }

    #[cfg(not(/* like above */)]
    unsafe fn dmb(&self) {
        // No-op but still a compiler barrier because of "memory"
        asm!("" : : : "memory" : "volatile");
    }
}
```

That is on sub-architectures where the DMB instruction doesn't exist, the
`__dmb` intrinsic will be equivalent to a compiler barrier.

## Hints

References: Section 7.4 "Hints" and Section "Section 7.7 NOP" of [ACLE].

### API

The following API will be available under `{core,std}::arch::{arm,aarch64}` and
will be available for both the "arm" and "aarch64" architectures.

``` rust
/// Generates a WFI (wait for interrupt) hint instruction, or nothing.
///
/// The WFI instruction allows (but does not require) the processor to enter a
/// low-power state until one of a number of asynchronous events occurs.
pub unsafe fn __wfi() { /* .. */ }

/// Generates a WFE (wait for event) hint instruction, or nothing.
///
/// The WFE instruction allows (but does not require) the processor to enter a
/// low-power state until some event occurs such as a SEV being issued by
/// another processor.
pub unsafe fn __wfe() { /* .. */ }

/// Generates a SEV (send a global event) hint instruction.
///
/// This causes an event to be signaled to all processors in a multiprocessor
/// system. It is a NOP on a uniprocessor system.
pub unsafe fn __sev() { /* .. */ }

/// Generates a send a local event hint instruction.
///
/// This causes an event to be signaled to only the processor executing this
/// instruction. In a multiprocessor system, it is not required to affect the
/// other processors.
pub unsafe fn __sevl() { /* .. */ }

/// Generates a YIELD hint instruction.
///
/// This enables multithreading software to indicate to the hardware that it is
/// performing a task, for example a spin-lock, that could be swapped out to
/// improve overall system performance.
pub unsafe fn __yield() { /* .. */ }

/// Generates a DBG instruction.
///
/// This provides a hint to debugging and related systems. The argument must be
/// a constant integer from 0 to 15 inclusive. See implementation documentation
/// for the effect (if any) of this instruction and the meaning of the
/// argument. This is available only when compliling for AArch32.
#[rustc_args_required_const(0)]
pub unsafe fn __dbg(_: u32) { /* .. */ }

/// Generates an unspecified no-op instruction.
///
/// Note that not all architectures provide a distinguished NOP instruction. On
/// those that do, it is unspecified whether this intrinsic generates it or
/// another instruction. It is not guaranteed that inserting this instruction
/// will increase execution time.
pub unsafe fn __nop() { /* .. */ }
```

### Implementation

Quoting Section 7.4 "Hints" of [ACLE][] :

> The intrinsics in this section are available for all targets. They may be
> no-ops (i.e. generate no code, but possibly act as a code motion barrier in
> compilers) on targets where the relevant instructions do not exist.  On
> targets where the relevant instructions exist but are implemented as no-ops,
> these intrinsics generate the instructions

So like in the implementation of memory barriers these intrinsics will do
nothing on *some* sub-architectures.

## System register access

Reference: Section 9 "System register access" of [ACLE].

### API

The following API will be available under `{core,std}::arch::{arm,aarch64}` and
will be available for both the "arm" and "aarch64" architectures.

``` rust
/// Reads a 32-bit system register
pub unsafe fn __arm_rsr<R>(special_register: R) -> u32
where
    R: Rsr
{
    /* .. */
}

/// Reads a 64-bit system register
pub unsafe fn __arm_rsr64<R>(special_register: R) -> u64
where
    R: Rsr64
{
    /* .. */
}

/// Reads a system register containing an address
pub unsafe fn __arm_rsrp<R>(special_register: R) -> *const c_void
where
    R: Rsrp
{
    /* .. */
}

/// Writes a 32-bit system register
pub unsafe fn __arm_wsr<R>(special_register: R, value: u32)
where
    R: Wsr
{
    /* .. */
}

/// Writes a 64-bit system register
pub unsafe fn __arm_wsr64<R>(special_register: R, value: u64)
where
    R: Wsr64
{
    /* .. */
}

/// Writes a system register containing an address
pub unsafe fn __arm_wsrp<R>(special_register: R, value: *const c_void)
where
    R: Wsrp
{
    /* .. */
}
```

The values that can be used for the `special_register` argument depend on the
target subarchitecture and whether the register is a 32-bit register or a 64-bit
register.

Possible 32-bit system registers (see `__arm_rsr`, `__arm_rsrp`, `__arm_wsr`,
and `__arm_wsrp`) include:

- The values accepted in the `spec_reg` field of the MRS instruction, for
  example CPSR. See [ARMARM] for more details.

- The values accepted in the `spec_reg` field of the MSR (immediate)
  instruction. See [ARMARM] for more details.

- The  values  accepted  in  the `spec_reg` field of the VMRS instruction, for
  example FPSID. See [ARMARM] for more details.

- The  values  accepted  in  the `spec_reg` field of the VMSR instruction, for
  example FPSCR. See [ARMARM] for more details.

- The values accepted in the `spec_reg` field of the MSR and MRS instructions
  with virtualization extensions, for example ELR_Hyp. See [ARMARM] for more
  details.

- The values specified in Special register encodings used in Armv7-M system
  instructions, for example PRIMASK. See [ARMv7M] for more details.

Possible 64-bit system registers (see `__arm_rsr64`, `__arm_rsrp64`,
`__arm_wsr64`, and `__arm_wsrp64`) include:

- The values accepted in the pstatefield of the MSR (immediate) instruction. See
  [ARMARMv8] for more details.

### Example usage

``` rust
use core::arch::arm::{BASEPRI, self};

unsafe {
    let new_val: u32 = /* .. */;
    let f = /* some closure */;

    let old_val = arm::__arm_rsr(BASEPRI);

    // start of critical section
    arm::__arm_wsr(BASEPRI, new_val);

    f();

    // end of critical section
    arm::__arm_wsr(BASEPRI, old_val);
}
```

In C you would write:

``` c
uint32_t old_val, new_val;
void* f;

new_val = /* .. */;
f = /* .. */;

old_val = __arm_rsr("BASEPRI");
__arm_wsr("BASEPRI", new_val)
f();
__arm_wsr("BASEPRI", old_val)
```

### Implementation

The important part of the implementation is double checking that special
register `struct`s are only available on the sub-architectures where they are
physically present.

``` rust
pub trait Rsr: sealed::Trait {
    unsafe fn rsr(&self) -> u32;
}

pub trait Wsr: sealed::Trait {
    unsafe fn wsr(&self, value: u32);
}

mod sealed {
    trait Trait {}
}

pub unsafe fn __arm_rsr<R>(special_register: R) -> u32
where
    R: Rsr
{
    special_register.rsr();
}

pub unsafe fn __arm_wsr<R>(special_register: R, value: u32)
where
    R: Wsr
{
    special_register.wsr(value)
}

#[cfg(target_feature = "mclass")]
pub struct BASEPRI;

#[cfg(target_feature = "mclass")]
impl Rsr for BASEPRI {
    fn rsr(&self) -> u32 {
        let r: u32;
        asm!("mrs $0, BASEPRI" : "=r"(r) ::: "volatile");
        r
    }
}

#[cfg(target_feature = "mclass")]
impl Wsr for BASEPRI {
    fn wsr(&self, value: u32) {
        asm!("msr BASEPRI, $0" :: "r"(value) : "memory" : "volatile")
    }
}
```

## 32-bit SIMD

Reference: Section 8.5 "32-bit SIMD intrinsics" of [ACLE].

*TODO*, but at least I should tell you that this is *not* about NEON. [ACLE]
says so in Section 8.5.1 "Availability":

> Armv6 introduced instructions to perform 32-bit SIMD operations (i.e. two
> 16-bit operations or four 8-bit operations) on the Arm general-purpose
> registers. These instructions are not related to the much more versatile
> Advanced SIMD (NEON) extension, whose support is described in Advanced SIMD
> (NEON) intrinsics.

And in Section 5.4.9 "32-bit SIMD instructions"

> __ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32 is defined to 1 if the 32-bit SIMD instructions are
> supported and the intrinsics defined in 32-bit SIMD intrinsics are available.
> This also implies support for the GE global flags which indicate byte-by-byte
> comparison results.

> __ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32 is deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. Users are
> encouraged to use NEON Intrinscs as an equivalent for the 32-bit SIMD
> intrinsics functionality. However they are fully supported for M and
> R-profiles. This is defined for AArch32 only.

So these are mainly Cortex-M and Cortex-R specific intrinsics.

This section will list the SIMD intrinsics to expose in `core::arch::arm` and
will propose that they are only exposed on `+mclass` and `+rclass` ARMv7
targets.
