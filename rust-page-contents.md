## Why Rust for embedded development?

> NOTE: These are currently two rows of three icons and snippets

### Powerful static analysis

Rust type system lets you enforce pin and peripheral configuration at compile time. Its ownership system guarantees that resources won't be used by unintended parts of the application.

[Learn More](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/embedded-wg/issues/118)

### Flexible memory management

Dynamic memory (heap) allocation is optional. Use a global allocator and dynamic data structures from the Rust standard library. Or leave out heap allocation altogether and statically allocate everything.

### Safe Concurrency

Rust memory safety holds regardless of the concurrency framework. Be it threads with explicit shared memory or tasks with message passing.

### Interoperability

Integrate Rust into your existing C codebase or leverage an existing SDK to write a Rust application.

### Portability

Write a library / driver once and use it with a variety of systems ranging from very small microcontrollers to powerful SBCs.
